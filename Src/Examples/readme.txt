This directory contains examples of the use of the Dynamo 
classes. There is a simple example showing a swinging chain
of cubes in the Basic directory. The example in the SelfAssembly
directory adds some code to that to make the chain self-assemble.
The example in the FloorCollisions shows how collision handling
can be added to the basic example.

The Shared directory contains some files that are used by all
examples for rendering purposes. These are for a PC version using
Microsoft Visual C++ and Direct3D. For other platforms you'll have
to provide the render functionality yourself. John Nagle (see
http://www.animats.com) has graciously donated the openGL rendering
functionality, and Vincent Harvey has donated the GLUT rendering
functionality.

The bin directory is for the executables.
