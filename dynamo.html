<A NAME="intro"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Introduction</FONT></H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Dynamo is a software library providing classes that takes care of
the calculation of the motions of geometries moving under the influence of
forces and torques and impulses. In addition, the library can also compute
forces for you through the mechanism of <em>constraints</em>. These allow
you to easily connect geometries to each other in various ways. A constraint
only has to be specified once, and the Dynamo library will continually enforce
it from that moment on by applying the required reaction forces. Some of the
Dynamo's features are:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Full forward dynamics support for forces, torques and impulses.</FONT><BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Runs side-by-side with your application, and has a low-bandwidth
interface communicating the newly calculated positions and orientations to your
application.</FONT><BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Fast, tunable inverse dynamics support via constraints.</FONT><BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Over a dozen constraints available, including several types of
hinges and a constraint for collision response calculations.</FONT><BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Support for controllers, activators and sensors.</FONT><BR>
<BR></LI>

LI> <FONT SIZE=+1>Fully object oriented design, allowing for easy extension of
the library by adding your own constraints and controllers via inheritance:
just derive your own class from the provided <em>constraint</em> or <em>controller</em>
classes by implementing a few predefined methods.</FONT></LI> </UL>

<H1>
<A NAME="requires"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Requirements</FONT></H2>
<FONT SIZE=+1>The library is written in C++. It has been complied and tested on
Sun and Silicon Graphics workstations using the standard CC compilers, and on
the PC using MS Visual C++ 5.0.</FONT>

<H1><A NAME="doc"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Documentation and publications</FONT></H1>

<P>First, some older publications, based on my work for my Masters in which
I added dynamics to one of our animation programs:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="publications/mtfbwy.zip">May the Force be with you</A>: this is a
synopsis of the main findings of my Master's Thesis. It was written for
a course in Technical Writing and Editing which I took during my time as
an OOTI (so that I now am an <A HREF="http://www.win.tue.nl/xootic/">Xootic</A>). It serves as
a nice introduction to the field of motion dynamics, and should also be
readable while skipping all the formulae-bits for those who just want an
overview without too many details. </LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="publications/aynif.pdf">All
you need is force</A>, which I co-wrote with my supervisor
C.W.A.M van Overveld, was presented at the Workshop for Computer Animation
and Simulation at EuroGraphics '95 (by me). It builds upon the work I did
for my Master's Thesis, but presents the problem in a more general setting
which suggest the approach taken in the work below. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Using what I learned before, I restarted builing a seperate object-oriented
dynamics library as the final project of the OOTI
course. Here is the report describing that design:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="gdpdyna.zip">Designing a library for constraint driven dynamics
in the GDP</A>: this is my final report of the postgraduate
programme Software Technology and describes the first part part of
my PhD work, which has led to the Dynamo library. Here the ideas and algorithms
are presented in an Object Oriented environment, which in my opinion leads to a
much more intuitive view on the subject matter. </LI>
</UL>

<P> Afterwards, I extended this library to what has become Dynamo in my
h.D. work. The resulting thesis describing the design of Dynamo (which
I defended on April 27th 2000) is now available in 
<a href="publications/bartbthesis.pdf">pdf format</a> (1.1MB).

<P> The library has been developed for use in a host application. For
tests and demos it has been incorporated in our GDP system.
Here is the documentation for both the stand-alone Dynamo library, and also for
the additional functionality provided bythe GDP wrapper:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Here is the <A HREF="DLdoc_toc.html">user documentation</A> for the
stand-alone Dynamo library.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Here are <A HREF="Lks/Html/classbrowser.html">class interface definitions</A>
for the Looks language: the language used by the
GDP.
</LI>
</UL>

<H1><A NAME="examples"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Examples</FONT></H1>

<P>An example is shown in the following <A HREF="coaster.mpg">mpeg
movie</A> which shows a sort of roller coaster. The motion in this animation
is specified through the geometry of the track and the cart, a <I>constraint</I>
that specifies that the cart is connected to the track (but can move freely
along the track), a <I>constraint</I> that specifies that both parts of
the cart are connected through a pin joint, and the specification of gravity.
The system will calculate and apply reaction forces such that the two parts
of the cart and the track and the cart remain connected (but the gravity
will cause the cart to slide along the track). </P>

<P>Another example featuring a rolling bicycle is presented
<A HREF="bike/bike.html">here</A>.</P>


<H1><A NAME="download"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Download</FONT></H1>
Dynamo is available for downloading as a zip file:
<A HREF="dynamo.zip">dynamo.zip</A> (1MB zip file)<br>
Also available are the <a href="Lks/LksDemo.zip">Looks
sources</a> of the examples in the thesis (70KB zip file)


<H1><A NAME="install"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>Installation</FONT></H1>
<FONT SIZE=+1>The <a href="DLdoc_toc.html">user documentation</a> provides
instructions on the two callback functions which need to be implemented to
allow the library to communicate with your software. A make file is provided
for compiling on a Sun or SGI workstation. The example which is provided shows
how the library might be compiled on a PC.</FONT>

<LI>
<FONT SIZE=+1>In order to use the collision response constraint in Dynamo, a
collision detector is required. The <a
HREF="http://www.win.tue.nl/~gino/solid/">SOLID</a> library provides such a
detector and has been designed with (a.o.) physics-based interactive-speed
animation in mind.</FONT></LI>
