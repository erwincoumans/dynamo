Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC2">Preamble</A></H2>

<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

</P>
<P>
  This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
your libraries, too.

</P>
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

</P>
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

</P>
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

</P>
<P>
  Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

</P>
<P>
  Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
the original authors' reputations.

</P>
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
free use or not licensed at all.

</P>
<P>
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
the same as in the ordinary license.

</P>
<P>
  The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
treats it as such.

</P>
<P>
  Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

</P>
<P>
  However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
will lead to faster development of free libraries.

</P>
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
works together with the library.

</P>
<P>
  Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
General Public License rather than by this special one.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>

This License Agreement applies to any software library which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
<LI>

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

<LI>

You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:


<OL>
<LI>

The modified work must itself be a software library.

<LI>

You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

<LI>

You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

<LI>

If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
</OL>

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

<LI>

You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

<LI>

You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

<LI>

A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

<LI>

As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

<LI>

Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

<LI>

If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

<LI>

Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
</OL>

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

<LI>

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:


<OL>
<LI>

Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

<LI>

Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
</OL>

<LI>

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

<LI>

You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

<LI>

Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

<LI>

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

<LI>

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

<LI>

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Library General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

<LI>

If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

<P>
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest

everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

</P>
<P>
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the

<H1><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC5">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
This is the user documentation for the Dynamo Library: a C++ class
library developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology for handling
dynamics and inverse dynamics motion behaviour in computer animation and
simulation.

</P>
<P>
This documentation is structured as follows: first, a very brief
overview is given of what (inverse) dynamics entails. Then the few
things needed to connect the library to a host system are
discussed. This involves implementing a few simple callbacks. Once these
callbacks have been implemented, the library can be used. That is what
the remainder of this documentation focuses on, by first giving some
general hints about the usage of the library, and then presenting the
API of the library. In this API description all relevant classes in the
library are presented along with a description of each of their methods.

</P>
<P>
More in-depth documentation describing the theory on which the library
is based can be found at the author's home page on the Internet at url
<SAMP>`http://www.win.tue.nl/win/cs/tt/bartb/'</SAMP>. For questions, the author
can be reached at e-mail address <SAMP>`bartb@win.tue.nl'</SAMP>.

</P>



<H1><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC6">Dynamics overview</A></H1>

<P>
Dynamics provides a way to specify motion behaviour for an animation or
simulation. Unlike kinematics, where motions are specified in terms of
translations and rotations, dynamics uses forces and torques to set the
animation geometries in motion. The dynamics algorithms use the laws of
physics to calculate the motion of objects. In order to be able to
calculate the dynamic motions, some physical properties of the animated
objects are required, such as the mass of the objects.

</P>
<P>
Inverse dynamics provides a tool to specify the dynamics forces on a
higher level by stating properties of the dynamics objects. Inverse
dynamics takes care of calculating and applying the (reaction) forces
that maintain those properties. The properties are specified in
so-called "constraints". A constraint might for example specify that two
objects are to remain connected in a given manner at all times (with a
ball joint, or a pin joint for example). The constraint then acts as a
hinge between the two objects by calculating and applying the hinge
force. The advantage of constraints is that they can be used in a
declarative fashion: once a constraint is specified, the inverse
dynamics engine will make sure it remains satisfied for the remainder of
the animation/simulation (or until the constraint is "deactivated").

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC7">General notes</A></H1>

<P>
The task of the Dynamo Library is calculate the motions of the
geometric objects that are under its control. These geometric objects
exist outside the Dynamo library, and so the library itself maintains
companion objects that make the information required for the dynamics
calculation available to the objects in the library.

</P>
<P>
The calculations themselves are controlled by two system components: one
of type <CODE>DL_dyna_system</CODE> (for the forward dynamics), and one of
type <CODE>DL_constraint_manager</CODE> (for the inverse dynamics). The
dyna system component provides the entry-point for the dynamics
calculation in the form of the <CODE>dynamics()</CODE> method: this method is
to be called once for each time step in the animation/simulation and will
take care that all the dynamically controlled objects (`dynas' for
short) will also make a time step according to their inertia, external
forces and torques, and the constraints imposed on them. The method is
also available as a C-function <CODE>dynamics()</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes constraints are specified between a dyna and a geometric
object that is not under control of the Dynamo library. Companion
objects (`geos') for such objects are also maintained by the library.
The dyna system object provides methods that enable you to register a
geometric object as either a geo or a dyna. When the <CODE>dynamics</CODE>
method make a time step, it assumes that the geos have already made
their step: that way it can position the dynas in such a way that at the
new time, the constraints are valid again.

</P>
<P>
The header files for the Dynamo library list more classes, attributes
and methods than described in this document. However, only the methods
documented here are intended to be used externally to the library. Other
methods (which are marked as such) are present in the header
definitions, but are only for use by other classes in the library. The
classes in the Dynamo library have the prefix <CODE>DL_</CODE> prepended to
their name to distinguish them from other classes.

</P>
<P>
Points and vectors are often expressed in the local coordinate system of
some geo. So often you see as parameters a pair <CODE>DL_point *p,
DL_geo *g</CODE>, expressing that point <CODE>p</CODE> is given in the local
coordinate system of geo <CODE>g</CODE>. In such cases, <CODE>g</CODE> can be passed
the value <CODE>NULL</CODE> to indicate that <CODE>p</CODE> is given in world
coordinates.

</P>


<H1><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC8">Installation</A></H1>

<P>
Before the Dynamo library can be used, several things have to be done.

</P>
<P>
Since the dynamics calculations are carried out by the dyna system and
the constraint manager object (see the General notes section), those two
objects need be created during the initialization (if no inverse
dynamics is used, the creation of the constraint manager object may be
omitted). Moreover, the dyna_system object requires a motion integrator
to be present (see the section on forward dynamics), so a motion
integrator of choice will have to be created and installed as well

</P>
<P>
For the information exchange between the actual geometric objects and
their companions, a few very simple callbacks have to be
implemented. These callbacks are grouped together in a class-definition
<CODE>DL_dyna_system_callbacks</CODE>. Its API is given below, and the class
is meant to be used as a superclass for an actual implementation. An
object of this class also needs to be created during the initialization
phase to serve as a companion for the dyna system object.

</P>
<P>
An object of this class is used as companion to the dyna_system. Since
the dyna_system also needs a reference to a force_drawer, this callbacks
class inherits from the <CODE>DL_force_drawer</CODE> class so its methods can
(optionally) be implemented too and are easily accessible.

</P>

<PRE>
class <B>DL_dyna_system_callbacks</B> : public <B>DL_force_drawer</B> {
    void update_dyna_companion(DL_dyna*);

<P>
Only the first two methods need to be implemented: the others are
optional since they have a default implementation:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system_callbacks::update_dyna_companion(DL_dyna *d)</CODE>
<DD>
This method should copy the newly calculated position and orientation of
a dyna to its geometric companion object after its new position is
calculated. 

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system_callbacks::get_new_geo_info(DL_geo *g)</CODE>
<DD>
This method has the same function as the <CODE>update_dyna_companion</CODE>
method, but does its copying in the other direction. It is used to copy
new information from a non-dynamically controlled geometric object to
its companion in the Dynamo library.  Its argument provides a reference
to the <CODE>DL_geo</CODE> who's position and orientation need to be
updated. The <CODE>DL_geo</CODE> class has a method <CODE>move</CODE> especially for
this purpose. A reference to the companion object of this <CODE>DL_geo</CODE>
can be retrieved using its <CODE>get_companion()</CODE> method. The difference
between this callback and the <CODE>get_first_geo_info</CODE> callback is that
the latter is used to initialise a companion (so it has to set the
motion state for time <CODE>t</CODE> as well as for time <CODE>t+h</CODE>), and this
callback is used to increment the time by shifting the next motion state
into the current one, and only specify the new motion motion state.
  
<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system_callbacks::get_first_geo_info(DL_geo *g)</CODE>
<DD>
This method is used to copy the information from a geometric object to
its companion in the Dynamo library when the companion is created.
Its argument provides a reference to the <CODE>DL_geo</CODE> who's positions
and orientations need to be set. A reference to the companion object of
this <CODE>DL_geo</CODE> can be retrieved using its <CODE>get_companion()</CODE>
method. The default implementation of this method calls the
<CODE>get_new_geo_info</CODE> method to obtain the position and orientation
of the geometry, and copies this into both the new and current motion
states, while setting the velocities to zero. For non-zero initial
velocities, this method should be overriden.
  
<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system_callbacks::check_inertiatensor(DL_dyna*)</CODE>
<DD>
The dynamic calculations for each dyna depend on some of the physical
properties of the dyna, such as its mass and its tensor of
inertia. This callback gives the geometric companion object of a dyna
a chance to update these properties if necessary (for example when the
geometric companion object has been deformed).

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system_callbacks::do_collision_detection()</CODE>
<DD>
The Dynamo library has a <CODE>collision</CODE> constraint for collision
handling. But it relies on external collision detection to determine
when such a constraint should be created. This callback is used to call
the collision detector at the right moment. This callback should
implement a call to the collision detector to do its work (possibly
preceded by updating the positions of the geometries in the collision
detector's datastructures), which in turn should create collision
constraints upon detection of a collision.

The collision detection should use the estimates for the next motion
state to determine if a collision is taking place. To this end, the
geometry class has a set of methods (not listed in its interface
description below, since they normally are only used by the other
components of Dynamo, and only have valid values during the dynamics
phase) for retrieving the geometry's properties based on the estimate
for next frame's motion state. See the <CODE>geo.h</CODE> file for their
interfaces.

When overlap is detected by a collision detector, it is usually a good
idea to only create a collision constraint for the case where the
colliding geometries are moving closer to each other: if they are
already moving away from each other (maybe because of a collision
constraint in the previous frame), the "mirror the velocity" approach
of Dynamo's collision constraint only has adverse effects.

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system_callbacks::Msg(char *fmt, ...)</CODE>
<DD>
This method is used by Dynamo to send messages (warnings, errors,
notificications) to the outside world. The default implementation
prints the message on stderr, but for windowing systems it is often
better to reroute these messages to some window.

ancestors, and then the DL_List class can be used to list such items. An
item can only occur in one list at a time.

</P>
<P>
The list element class does not have any public methods (only methods
visible to DL_List), so its API is rather simple:

</P>

<PRE>
class <B>DL_ListElem</B> {
    DL_ListElem();
    ~DL_ListElem();
}
</PRE>

<P>
The DL_List is the actual list class which can store elements of type
<CODE>DL_ListElem</CODE>. Here is its API:

</P>

<PRE>
class <B>DL_List</B> {
   void addelem(DL_ListElem*);
   void addbefore(DL_ListElem*,DL_ListElem*);
   void addafter(DL_ListElem*,DL_ListElem*);

<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC15">Forward dynamics classes</A></H1>

<P>
The forward dynamics subsystem handles everything that has to do with
making geometric objects respond to forces, torques and inertia. The
main component is the dyna system, which manages all the dynas and
geos, and which will make sure that the motions of the dynas are
calculated and communicated to their companions.

</P>
<P>
The following sections describe the different classes in the forward
dynamics subsystem and their API's

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC16">Force Drawables</A></H2>

<P>
Since the dynamics system revolves around (the effects) of forces,
torques and impulse exchanges, such `actuators' will often have to be
visualised. Visualisation is handled by the host system, but
force_drawables provides a uniform interface for controlling if forces,
torques and impulse exchanges are visualised.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC17">Force Drawable</A></H3>

<P>
The <CODE>DL_force_drawable class</CODE>
is used as base class for for example the controller and constraint
classes and any otehr classes that have `actuators' that might need to
be visualised.

</P>

<PRE>
class <B>DL_force_drawable</B> {
    virtual void show_forces();

       ~DL_force_drawable(); // destructor
}
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>void DL_force_drawable::show_forces()</CODE>
<DD>
This method registers this force_drawable with the force_drawer so that
its `actuators' are visualised.

<DT><CODE>void DL_force_drawable::hide_forces()</CODE>
<DD>
This method removes this force_drawable from the force_drawer so that
its `actuators' are not visualised anymore.

<DT><CODE>void DL_force_drawable::get_fd_info(int&#38; nrf, int&#38; tf)</CODE>
<DD>
This method is used by the force_drawer to retrieve the number of
actuators that should be drawn. A difference is made between forces
and reaction forces, torques and reaction torques etc. The actuators
are numbered from zero to <CODE>nrf</CODE>, and the reaction actuators are
numbered from <CODE>nrf</CODE> to <CODE>tf</CODE>. For each of the actuators between
zero and <CODE>tf</CODE> the <CODE>get_force_method</CODE> can then be called to
retrieve the actual information about the actuator.

By default this method returns two zeros indicating that no actuators
are to be shown: it should be overriden in any descendant of <CODE>DL_force_drawable</CODE>
that wants actuators to be visualised.

<DT><CODE>void DL_force_drawable::get_force_info(int i, DL_actuator_type&#38; at,</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_dyna*&#38; d, DL_point *p, DL_vector *f)</CODE>
<DD>
This method is used by the force_drawer to retrieve the actual
information about the <CODE>i</CODE>-th actuator of this force_drawable. It returns
in <CODE>at</CODE> the type of actuator using the enumeration type:
  <CODE>enum DL_actuator_type {none, force, torque, impulse}</CODE>
In <CODE>d</CODE> and <CODE>p</CODE> the attachement point of the actuator is
specified, and in <CODE>f</CODE> the actuator itself.

This method should be implemented by each descendant that wants to
visualise its actuators: by default it returns actuator type <CODE>none</CODE>
regardless of <CODE>i</CODE>.

</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC18">User Force Drawable</A></H3>

<P>
For existing classes that do not inherit from force_drawable, this class
provides a means to still visualise its `actuators'. It can create a
<CODE>usr_force_drawable</CODE> object and set its attributes to visualise one
`actuator'.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>boolean DL_usr_force_drawable::reaction</CODE>

This boolean indicates if the force is a reaction-force or not
(the forcedrawer might give reaction forces a different appearance
from the corresponding force).

<DT><CODE>DL_actuator_type DL_usr_force_drawable::at</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute signifies what type of actuator has to be visualised
here: its value is of the following enumeration type:

  <CODE>enum DL_actuator_type {none, force, torque, impulse}</CODE>

<DT><CODE>DL_dyna DL_usr_force_drawable::*d</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_point DL_usr_force_drawable::p</CODE>
<DD>
These two attributes specify the attachment point of the `actuator':
it is the point with local coordinates <CODE>p</CODE> in dyna <CODE>d</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>DL_vector DL_usr_force_drawable::f</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute finally specifies the `actuator' vector (in world
coordinates).

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC19">Force Drawer</A></H2>

<P>
The force_drawer class is the manager of force_drawable objects. It
provides the methods <CODE>register_fd</CODE> and <CODE>remove_fd</CODE> using which
DL_force_drawable objects can make sure their forces are visualised or
not (these are used in the <CODE>show_forces</CODE> and <CODE>hide_forces</CODE>
methods of such objects). The implementation of a force_drawer should
maintain a list of registered force_drawables, the `actuators' of which
should be visualised each frame. The class also provides a few methods
that enable any object to visualise an `actuator' for one frame (though
this is relatively expensive: if such an object has to visualise forces
for an extensive period of time, it had better use a
<CODE>usr_force_drawable</CODE> object). The class is ment as a base class for
the actual implementation in the host system which can do the actual
visualisation using the host system's visualisation primitives.

The dyna system is a one-of-a-kind object that steers the whole dynamics
process. It keeps track of all the dynas and the geos in the system, and
makes sure that they are activated properly. If there is a constraint

}
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DL_dyna_system_callbacks* DL_dyna_system::get_companion()</CODE>
<DD>
As explained in section <A HREF="DLdoc.html#SEC8">Installation</A>, the dyna system has a companion
of type <CODE>DL_dyna_system_callbacks</CODE> which is used for the
callbacks. This method provides easy access to that object (which was
provided to the dyna system in its constructor)

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system::dynamics()</CODE>
<DD>
This method is the entry point for the whole Dynamo library. Call this
method once a frame to have the dyna system update the positions and
orientations of all the dynamically controlled geometric objects with
respect to their inertia, applied forces and torques, and the
constraints imposed on them.
    
<DT><CODE>DL_geo* DL_dyna_system::register_geo(void *g)</CODE>
<DD>
This method is provided for establishing the links between a geo and
its companion. It takes a reference to a geometric object as an
argument, and will check if there is already a <CODE>DL_geo</CODE> companion
for this object. If so, it will return a reference to this object, if
not, it will create a companion for the object and return a reference
to it.

The method is typically used when initializing constraints in case
the constraint acts on a geometric object that is not dynamically
controlled. The constraints require a <CODE>DL_geo</CODE> as parameter, and
this method can be used to make sure that that geo is known to the
library, and to obtain the reference to it.

Note that dynas add and remove themselves to and from the dyna system
upon their creation and deletion, but for geos (many of which are
probably not of interest for the dynamics calculations) this is
inefficient, since the <CODE>get_new_geo_info</CODE> callback is called each
frame for each of the registered geos.

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system::remove_geo(DL_geo*)</CODE>
<DD>
if a geometric object is no longer required by the Dynamo library
(and it was made known to it using the <CODE>register_geo()</CODE> method,
its companion can be removed from the dyna system using this
method. This removes some overhead since the dyna systems inquires
about the new position and orientation of each geo at the beginning of
each time step.

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system::set_gravity(DL_vector *g)</CODE>
<DD>
This method sets the global gravity to <CODE>g</CODE>. This gravity
acceleration will be applied to all dynas in each frame of the
animation/simulation. 

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system::get_gravity(DL_vector *g)</CODE>
<DD>
This method assigns a copy of the current gravity vector to <CODE>g</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system::set_integrator(DL_m_integrator *mi)</CODE>
<DD>
This method sets the motion integrator used by all the dyna to
<CODE>mi</CODE>. The step size from the previous motion integrator
will be retained. Use this method to switch to a different (faster or
more accurate) type of integrator.

<DT><CODE>DL_m_integrator* DL_dyna_system::get_integrator()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns a reference to the current motion integrator.

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_dyna_system::kinenergy()</CODE>
<DD>
This methods returns the total amount of kinetic energy
in the system (i.e. of all dynas).

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_dyna_system::potenergy()</CODE>
<DD>
This methods returns the total amount of potential energy
in the system (i.e. of all dynas).

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_dyna_system::totenergy()</CODE>
<DD>
This methods returns the total amount of kinetic and potential energy
in the system (i.e. of all dynas).

<DT><CODE>int DL_dyna_system::frame_number()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns the number of times the <CODE>dynamics</CODE> method has
been called.

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_dyna_system::time()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns the current virtual time: the sum of stepsizes of
each of the calls to <CODE>dynamics</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system::show_controller_forces()</CODE>
<DD>
This method calls <CODE>show_forces</CODE> for all controllers that are
present in the system, and will make sure that it is called for any
controller that is added in the future.

<DT><CODE>void DL_dyna_system::hide_controller_forces()</CODE>
<DD>
This method calls <CODE>hide_forces</CODE> for all controllers that are
present in the system, and will make sure that it is called for any
controller that is added in the future.

<DT><CODE>boolean DL_dyna_system::showing_controller_forces()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns if controller forces are shown or not.

<DT><CODE>DL_dyna_system::DL_dyna_system(DL_dyna_system_callbacks *c, DL_m_integrator *i)</CODE>
<DD>
This is the constructor of the dyna system. The dyna system needs a
(reference to) a <CODE>DL_dyna_system_callbacks</CODE> object, so it can
communicate with its environment (see section <A HREF="DLdoc.html#SEC8">Installation</A>). It also needs a
reference to a motion integrator, so it knows in what manner to
integrate the motions of the dynas.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC21">Geo</A></H2>

<P>
Objects from the <CODE>DL_geo</CODE> class are companions to the geometric
objects in the host application. The class only functions to
administrate the two motion states (containing the position, velocity,
orientation and angular velocity at time <CODE>t</CODE> (the current time) and
at time <CODE>t+h</CODE> (the next time)) of such geometries, and provides an

<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC22">Dyna</A></H2>

<P>
A dyna is a dynamically controlled geo. Next to the motion state, a dyna
also administrates the geo's mass and moments of inertia, which it needs
to calculate the motion behaviour according to its inertia and the
applied forces and torques.

For the correct calculation of the motion of the dyna, it is assumed
that the origin of the dyna's local coordinate system is the dyna's
center of mass, and that the axis of the local coordinate system are the
major inertia axis. This is something to take into account when setting
up the local coordinate system of the companion of the dyna.

This methods sets the velocity damping of the dyna to <CODE>vd</CODE>. The
velocity damping is a coefficient which is applied to the inertia of the
dyna: 0 for no inertia, and 1 for full inertia. Its effect can be seen
as a very rough approximation of friction since velocity damping

<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC23">Motion Integrator</A></H2>

<P>
The dynas calculate their motions by integrating Newton's Law
`<EM>F=m a</EM>' (and a similar law for orientation). By providing the
integrator used in this calculation separately, we can choose the
integrator used at runtime. Several integrators are available, each with
their own advantages and disadvantages. The <CODE>DL_m_integrator</CODE> class
functions as an interface specification for all these integrators, so
that they can be addressed uniformly. Here is its API:

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_m_integrator::stepsize()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns the current step size of the integration.

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_m_integrator::halfstepsize()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns the half the current step size of the integration.

<DT><CODE>void DL_m_integrator::set_stepsize(DL_Scalar h)</CODE>
<DD>
Using this method one can specify the step size of the integration. Each
call to the <CODE>dynamics</CODE> method of the dyna system advances the time
by this step size.

</DL>

<P>
There are currently four kinds of motion integrators: two variants of
the first order Euler integrator, and second and fourth order Runge
Kutta integrators.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC24">Euler</A></H3>

<P>
The Euler motion integrator is a rather fast, but not so accurate motion
integrator. Its error is linear in the step size of the integration. Its
API is defined by the motion integrator API:

</P>

<PRE>

}
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC25">Double Euler</A></H3>

<P>
The double euler motion integrator takes two euler integration steps of
half the step size for each of its integration steps. It is therefore
about twice as expensive as the euler integrator (making it
approximately as fast as the Runge Kutta 2 integrator), and still of
linear order. Its API is defined by the motion integrator API:

</P>

<PRE>
class <B>DL_double_euler</B> : public <B>DL_m_integrator</B> {

    ~DL_double_euler();
}
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC26">Runge Kutta 2</A></H3>

<P>
The Runge Kutta 2 integrator is a second order integrator which (like
the double euler integrator) costs about twice as much as the euler
integrator. It is more accurate than the double euler integrator, and
therefore preferable to it.  Its API is defined by the motion integrator
API:

<P>
The Runge Kutta 4 motion integrator is a fourth order motion
integrator. It is very accurate, but at about four times the price of
the euler integrator.  Its API is defined by the motion integrator API:

<P>
The constraint manager is a one-of-a-kind object that controls the
inverse dynamics calculations. Constraints register themselves
automatically, and the dyna system will signal the constraint manager
each time constraint correction needs to take place. Its API only
provides access to the attributes that hold the parameter values that
control the constraint correction process. The default values for these
parameters should be fine in most cases, but for the more advanced
users they are available for fine-tuning. Here is the API:

</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>boolean DL_constraint_manager::analytical</CODE>
<DD>
This boolean determines how the constraint manager will determine how
changes in the reaction forces will change the constraint error:
analytically or empirically (using test forces). The analytical method
is faster, so by default the boolean is <CODE>true</CODE>

<DT><CODE>int DL_constraint_manager::MaxIter</CODE>
<DD>
The constraint manager adjusts the reaction forces in an iterative
manner, trying to decrease the constraint error in each step. The
<CODE>MaxIter</CODE> attribute specifies the maximum number of iterations per
frame (note that less iteration steps may actually be taken, if the
constraint error decreases below the thresh hold set by the
<CODE>max_error</CODE> attribute before the maximum number of iterations is
reached).

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_constraint_manager::max_error</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute governs the number of iterations used in the constraint
correction, together with the <CODE>MaxIter</CODE> attribute. It provides an
error thresh hold for the constraint error: as soon as the constraint
error is less than this thresh hold, constraint correction stops. Note
that iteration is also stopped if the maximum number of iterations as
determined by the <CODE>MaxIter</CODE> attribute is reached: the
<CODE>max_error</CODE> attribute therefore only provides a guaranty that the
final constraint error is indeed smaller than the thresh hold, if
<CODE>MaxIter</CODE> is sufficiently high.

<DT><CODE>int DL_constraint_manager::NrSkip</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute governs the recalculation of the dependencies between the
reaction forces and the constraint errors: this dependency is calculated
once every <CODE>NrSkip+1</CODE> frames. These dependencies are used to
determine how to change the reaction forces to bring the constraint
error to zero: the more accurate the dependencies are, the more faster
the constraint error will converge to zero. The default value is zero,
so the dependency is recalculated at the start of every frame.

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_constraint_manager::error</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute provides the most recently calculated constraint
error. This information can be used in adjusting the <CODE>MaxIter</CODE> and
<CODE>max_error</CODE> attributes, or to study the constraint correction
process itself. It is meant as a read-only attribute: changing it will
not have an effect.

<DT><CODE>int DL_constraint_manager::nriter</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute provides the actual number of iteration steps taken in the
last frame, so it provides an indication of the converge speed of the
constraint correction process. It is meant as a read-only attribute.

<DT><CODE>int DL_constraint_manager::max_collisionloops</CODE>
<DD>
When collision detection is used, this attribute governs the number of
times the collision detection routines are called to determine if there
are any secondary collisions. The default value of this attribute is
one, so there is no secondary collision detection within one frame by
default.

<DT><CODE>int DL_constraint_manager::get_nr_constraints();</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns the number of active constraints.

<DT><CODE>int DL_constraint_manager::get_dof();</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns the number of restricted degrees of freedom that the
constraint manager is currently managing.

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint_manager::solve_using_lud()</CODE>
<DD>
Solve for the reaction forces using LU decomposition and backward
substitution. Advantages of this method are that it is fast and the
processing time does not depend much on the configuration, so the frame
rate will be stable as far as solving is concerned. Disadvantage is
that it can only handle configuartaion which have exactly one solution
for the constraint forces.

<DT><CODE>boolean DL_constraint_manager::solving_using_lud()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns if the constraints are being solved using
LU decomposition and backward substitution.

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint_manager::solve_using_cg()</CODE>
<DD>
Solve for the reaction forces using conjugate gradient. This method can
handle configurations which have one or more solutions configurations,
but the required processing time depends on the configuration: it might
be very fast for "easy" configuration, but rather slow for "hard"
situations, thereby giving a large variance in framerate. In general it
is significantly slower than using LU decomposition, but more stable.

<DT><CODE>boolean DL_constraint_manager::solving_using_cg()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns if the constraints are being solved using conjugate
gradient solving

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint_manager::solve_using_svd()</CODE>
<DD>
Solve for the reaction forces using singular value decomposition. This
method can handle configurations with zero or more solutions (although
configurations with zero solutions, i.e. configurations with conflicting
constraints, can give rise to very large reaction forces), but in
general it is rather slow. So this is the most stable, though usually
slowest solution finding method.

<DT><CODE>boolean DL_constraint_manager::solving_using_svd()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns if the constraints are being solved using the singular
value decomposition method

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint_manager::show_constraint_forces()</CODE>
<DD>
This method calls <CODE>show_forces</CODE> for all constraints that are
present in the system, and will make sure that it is called for any
constraint that is added in the future.

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint_manager::hide_constraint_forces()</CODE>
<DD>
This method calls <CODE>hide_forces</CODE> for all constraints that are
present in the system, and will make sure that it is called for any
constraint that is added in the future.

<DT><CODE>boolean DL_constraint_manager::showing_constraint_forces()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns if constraint forces are shown or not.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC30">Constraint</A></H2>

<P>
The <CODE>DL-constraint</CODE> class is the generic constraint class (which
also doubles as the <EM>empty</EM> constraint which does not constrain
anything). It provides the common API for all inverse dynamics
constraints:

</P>

<PRE>

        ~DL_constraint();
}
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_constraint::stiffness</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute specifies the stiffness of the constraint. The stiffness
of a constraint is a factor which determines how much of the constraint's
error the constraint manager will attempt to correct in each iteration
step. The default value is one: attempt to correct all error in the
constraint. Lower (but non-negative) values will "soften" the
constraint with respect to other constraints (at a cost penalty, since
it will take the constraint error longer to converge to a value lower
than the constraint manager's <CODE>max_error</CODE> value).

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint::init()</CODE>
<DD>
Initialize the constraint. This method is only for when the constraint
is used as an empty constraint (which does not influence anything...).
it should not be used to initialize any of the specializations of the
constraint class: these have their own initialization methods.

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint::activate()</CODE>
<DD>
Activates the constraint (if it had been de-activated before:
constraints activate themselves upon initialization).

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint::deactivate()</CODE>
<DD>
Deactivate the constraint.

<DT><CODE>int DL_constraint::get_dim()</CODE>
<DD>
This method returns the dimension of the constraint: the number of
degrees of freedom the constraint restricts.

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint::soft()</CODE>
<DD>
This method softens constraints that are based on positional information
by also taking velocity into account: positions do not have to match if
there is a velocity that will make sure they match in the next
frame. This method makes sure that such velocity-terms are added for the
constraint correction from now on. Normally, velocity-terms are
only added (automatically) when required (velocity terms also help in
stabilizing some numerical artifact caused by the time discretization).
Softening constraints can be used in situations where constraints are
not valid initially, but are used for self assembling purposes. In such
cases, the self assembling proces will go smooth, instead of
instantanious (with the accompanying very large forces which can
destabelize calculations).

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint::hard()</CODE>
<DD>
This method is the counterpart of the <CODE>soft()</CODE> method: it makes
sure that the constraint is "hardened" by making sure that no velocity
terms are added from now on.

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint::auto_softhard()</CODE>
<DD>
This method can be used after invocation of soft() or hard() to
revert back to the automatic addition of velocity terms.

<DT><CODE>void DL_constraint::auto_softhard(int i)</CODE>
<DD>
This method specifies that this constraint is to be made soft once every
<CODE>i</CODE> frames from now on.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC31">Point-to-point constraint</A></H2>

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_ptp::maxforce</CODE>
<DD>
With this attribute, a maximum reaction force for the constraint can be
specified: if this maximum reaction force is exceed the constraint will
deactivate itself, so the connection `breaks'. A <CODE>maxforce</CODE> value
of zero or smaller indicates that there is no limit to the reaction
force magnitude. The default value is zero.
  
<DT><CODE>void DL_ptp::init(DL_dyna *d, DL_point *pd, DL_geo *g, DL_point *pg)</CODE>

This method initializes the constraint and activates it. It specifies
that the point-to-point constraint should keep the point of dyna
<CODE>d</CODE> with local coordinates <CODE>pd</CODE>, at the same position as the
point of geo <CODE>g</CODE> (which may be a dyna, since dyna inherits from
geo) with local coordinates <CODE>pg</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>void DL_ptp::reactionforce(DL_vector *f);</CODE>

This method returns a copy of the reaction force (in world coordinates)
in vector <CODE>f</CODE> (for visualization or for stress-evaluation for
example).

<DT><CODE>DL_dyna* DL_ptp::get_dyna()</CODE>

This method returns in <CODE>dp</CODE> a copy of the current attachment point

This method allows you to change the attachment point in the dyna. Use
this method with caution, since too large jumps in the attachment

The velocity-to-velocity constraint specifies that the velocities of two

remain the same. This constraint has a very similar effect as the
point-to-point constraint, except for some possible drift due to
residual errors after each frame's constraint correction, and except for
the behaviour in a situation where the constraint is not valid

This method initializes and activates the line-hinge constraint. It
specifies that the point with local coordinates <CODE>pd0</CODE> in dyna
<CODE>d</CODE> should coincide with the point with local coordinates
<CODE>pg0</CODE> in geo <CODE>g</CODE>, and that the point with local coordinates

line between <CODE>pd0</CODE> and <CODE>pd1</CODE> to the line between <CODE>pg0</CODE>

five. The two attachment point pairs should be sufficiently far apart

specified: if this maximum reaction force is exceed the constraint will
deactivate itself, so the connection `breaks'. A <CODE>maxforce</CODE> value
of zero or smaller indicates that there is no limit to the reaction
force magnitude. The default value is zero.

<DT><CODE>void DL_pts::init(DL_geo *g, DL_point *p, DL_surface *s)</CODE>

This method initializes the constraint, specifying that geo <CODE>g</CODE>
should remain connected to surface <CODE>s</CODE> in the point with local
coordinates <CODE>p</CODE>. For the constraint to be able to apply its
reaction force, either the surface should be part of a dyna, or <CODE>g</CODE>
should be a dyna. 

<DT><CODE>void DL_pts::reactionforce(DL_vector *f)</CODE>

The wheel constraint class provides a constraint type that can be used

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_wheel::maxforce</CODE>
<DD>
  
With this attribute, a maximum reaction force for the constraint can be
specified: if this maximum reaction force is exceed the constraint will
deactivate itself, so the connection `breaks'. A <CODE>maxforce</CODE> value
of zero or smaller indicates that there is no limit to the reaction

<DT><CODE>void DL_wheel::init(DL_dyna *w, DL_vector *n, DL_point *c, DL_Scalar r,</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_surface *sf, DL_Scalar s, DL_Scalar t)</CODE>
<DD>
This method initializes the constraint. The first four parameters
specify the wheel: <CODE>w</CODE> is the dyna, point <CODE>c</CODE> gives (in local
coordinates) the center of the wheel (normally this is point
<CODE>(0,0,0)</CODE>), vector <CODE>n</CODE> gives the normal of the wheel-plane,
and <CODE>r</CODE> is the radius of the wheel. The last three parameters
specify the <EM>road</EM> the wheel is rolling on: surface <CODE>sf</CODE>
describes this <EM>road</EM>, and the pair <CODE>(s,t)</CODE> gives the initial
position of the contact point of the wheel in the surface.

<DT><CODE>void DL_wheel::reactionforce(DL_vector *f)</CODE>

<H2><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC44">Collision constraint</A></H2>

<P>
The collision constraint class provides a constraint type that can
be used for collision handling of point-point collisions. A collision
detector can create collision constraints when it has detected that a
collision is taking place, and then the collision constraint will calculate
and apply the appropriate collision forces. A collision constraint
always deletes itself at the end of the frame, when it has been handled.
Here is its (current) API:

</P>

<PRE>
class <B>DL_collision</B> : public <B>DL_constraint</B> {
      DL_collision(DL_geo*, DL_point*,
                   DL_geo*, DL_point*,
                   DL_vector*, int mode=1);
      ~DL_collision();
}
</PRE>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>DL_collision::DL_collision(DL_geo *g0, DL_point *p0,</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_geo *g1, DL_point *p1, DL_vector *n, int mode=0)</CODE>
<DD>
The constructor of the collision constraint class is also used to
initialize the constraint. It specifies that a collision between geo
<CODE>g0</CODE> and <CODE>g1</CODE> (at least one of which should be a dyna) will be
handled. The contact point in the first geo is given by local
coordinates <CODE>p0</CODE>. The contact point in the second geo is given by
local coordinates <CODE>p1</CODE>.

Vector <CODE>n</CODE> is the collision normal which is used to determine the
direction of the collision reaction force. For a point-plane collision
this is the normal of the plane for example. It does not matter to
which side of the plane the normal points.

The <CODE>mode</CODE> parameter is optional. It allows control over the way the
collision is handled: a value of 1 signifies handling via a velocity
constraint only. A value larger than one adds positional constraints.
A value smaller than 1 lets the collision constraint decide whether
to imploy the extra positional constraint or not (this is the default
behaviour).

The elasticity of the collision is determined from the elasticity values
given for the colliding geometries.

<H1><A NAME="SEC45" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC45">Miscellaneous classes</A></H1>

<P>
In this section the remaining classes in the Dynamo library are
presented. First, the curve and the surface classes are discussed which
can be used to model the curves and surfaces required by the
point-to-curve and the point-to-surface constraints. Then the generic
controller class and the one controller (for modeling dampers and
(damped) springs).

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC46">Curves</A></H2>

<P>
The curve classes are used to model explicit curves: functions from
one curve parameter to 3-D points. These are the curves that are use by the
point-to-curve constraint (see section <A HREF="DLdoc.html#SEC39">Point-to-curve constraint</A>). With each curve, a geo is
associated: the curve is expressed in the local coordinate system of
that geo (or in world coordinates if the geo-reference happens to be the
<CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer).  In case the geo is a dyna, the point-to-curve
constraint's reaction forces are also applied to this geo. The
<CODE>DL_curve</CODE> class is the generic explicit curve class which presents the
general curve-API, while the other classes presented here are actual
implementations of specific types of curves.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC47">Curve</A></H3>

<H2><A NAME="SEC55" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC55">Surfaces</A></H2>

<P>
The surface classes are used to model explicit surfaces: functions from
one surface parameter pair to 3-D points. These are the surfaces that
are use by the point-to-surface constraint (see section <A HREF="DLdoc.html#SEC40">Point-to-surface constraint</A>). With each
surface, a geo is associated: the surface is expressed in the local
coordinate system of that geo (or in world coordinates if the
geo-reference happens to be the <CODE>NULL</CODE> pointer). In case the geo is a
dyna, the point-to-surface constraint's reaction force is also applied
to this geo. The <CODE>DL_surface</CODE> class is the generic surface class
which presents the general explicit surface-API, while the other classes
discussed here are actual implementations of specific types of surfaces.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC56">Surface</A></H3>

The generic explicit surface class provides the generic API for

<H2><A NAME="SEC67" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC67">Controllers</A></H2>

<P>
Controllers are objects that calculate and apply controller forces once
each frame, in contrast to constraints which --within a frame-- can
repeatedly improve on the reaction forces and can also `look ahead' at
the results of the application of the forces. As a result of this,
controllers are usually of a `slower', less exact nature than
constraints, but they also take less computational effort. Often
a controller is used in concert with a constraint to regulate the degrees
of freedom that the constraint leaves free.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC68" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC68">Controller</A></H3>

<P>
The controller class provides a base-class for controllers.  This base
class makes sure that controllers are registered with the dyna system,
and that they indeed are prompted once a frame to calculate and apply
their controller force. The `deactivate' and `activate' methods can be
used to (temporarily) deactivate and reactivate the controller. Only the
controller's descendants should be instantiated.

The spring class is used to model (dampened) springs. As with

used to model dampers: in that case a spring constant of zero and a non-zero
damping constant are used.

magnitude. For a negative <CODE>maxforce</CODE> value, the spring does not
deactivate itself when the maxforce magnitude is exceeded, but the

<P>
The torquespring class is used to model (dampened) rotational springs
that try to enforce a relative orientation of two vectors around a given
axis. Upon initialization the three evctors have to be given, optionally
with the rest-angle of the spring, the spring constant, and -if
required- a damping factor. This class can also be used to model
dampers: in that case a spring constant of zero and a non-zero damping
constant are used.

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_torquespring::maxtorque</CODE>
<DD>
With this attribute, a maximum spring torque for the controller can be
specified: if this maximum force is exceed the controller will
deactivate itself, so the connection `breaks'. A <CODE>maxtorque</CODE> value
of zero indicates that there is no limit to the spring torque
magnitude. For a negative <CODE>maxtorque</CODE> value, the spring does not
deactivate itself when the maxtorque magnitude is exceeded, but the
portion of the torque exceeding the maxtorque value is not applied. The
default value for <CODE>maxtorque</CODE> is zero.

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_torquespring::a</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute specifies the rest angle of the spring (initial value: 0)

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_torquespring::c</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute specifies the spring constant (initial value: 0)

<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar DL_torquespring::dc</CODE>
<DD>
This attribute specifies the damping constant (initial value: 0)

<DT><CODE>void DL_torquespring::init(DL_dyna *d, DL_vector *dd, DL_vector *dir,</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_geo *g, DL_vector *dg)</CODE>
<DD>
This method initializes the spring, specifying that the angle is to be
determined between vector <CODE>dd</CODE> in <CODE>d</CODE> and vector <CODE>dg</CODE> in
<CODE>g</CODE>, around vector <CODE>dir</CODE> in <CODE>d</CODE> (all vectors in local
coordinates of their respective geometries). This method leaves the rest
length, and the spring and damping constants at their current value.

<DT><CODE>void DL_torquespring::init(DL_dyna *d, DL_vector *dd, DL_vector *dir,</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_geo *g, DL_vector *dg,</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar a, DL_Scalar c)</CODE>
<DD>
This method initializes the spring just like the method above, but also
specifies the new rest angle to be <CODE>a</CODE>, and the new spring
constant to be <CODE>c</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>void DL_torquespring::init(DL_dyna *d, DL_vector *dd, DL_vector *dir,</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_geo *g, DL_vector *dg,</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>DL_Scalar a, DL_Scalar c, DL_Scalar dc)</CODE>
<DD>
This method initializes the spring just like the method above, but also
specifies the new damping constant to be <CODE>dc</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>void DL_torquespring::springtorque(DL_vector *t)</CODE>
<DD>
This method assigns the most recently calculated spring torque to <CODE>t</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="SEC71" HREF="DLdoc_toc.html#TOC71">PID Controller</A></H3>

<P>
The PID controller class is a class of controllers that works in
conjunction with the sensor and actuator classes. It tries to activate
the actuator in such a way that the sensor reading from the sensor
matches a given target signal (which may be varying over time). It does
so by measuring the error between the target value and the sensor value
and steering the actuator proportionally to that error, its integral,
and/or it's derivative.

</P>
<P>
The PID class can be used in two different ways:

<OL>
<LI>With the sensors and actuators from this class library.

      This method is used when the controller is provided with a
      sensor and an actuator upon contruction. The controller is
      the automatically activated and will start reading its sensor
      and applying its calculates actuator values.
<LI>With external means for measuring and applying actuator values.

      This method is used when the controller is not given a sensor and
      actuator upon contruction. The controller is not activated then,
      but a user can still call the <CODE>sens2act()</CODE> method each frame
      providing the controller with a sensor reading and getting the
      appropriate actuator value in return.
</OL>

<P>
For example, the <CODE>sensor_dist_v</CODE> (or <CODE>sensor_velo_v</CODE>) sensor
and the <CODE>actuator_fv</CODE> actuator can be combined with the PID
controller class to govern the left-over degree of freedom of the prism
constraint.
In the same manner, the <CODE>sensor_angle_v</CODE> (or <CODE>sensor_avelo_v</CODE>)
sensor and the <CODE>actuator_tv</CODE> actuator can be combined to control
the remaining degree of freedom of the linehinge constraint.

</P>

Here is the PID controller interface:
